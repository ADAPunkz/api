# ADAPunkz API

This API returns rarity and sales data for the NFT collection. Mint and sales information is updated via a background service bringing in new data from [NFT Maker PRO](https://pro.nft-maker.io), [CNFT.IO](https://cnft.io) and [jpg.store](https://jpg.store)

## Requirements

- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (or any .NET 6 environment)

## Contributing

Rules:

- Keep it focused. Desired code style can be inferred from the existing code base.
- Keep it light. Try to avoid adding external dependencies unless you really need to.
- Keep it generic. We, or others, may end up using this code for other NFTs.

git:
- All contributions should be branched from current `master`
- Branch name should follow the format `feat/featurename` for features, `fix/fixname` for fixes, and `chore/chorename` for chores
